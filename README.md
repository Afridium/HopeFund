HopeFund is a donation platform website I built to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Vanilla JS). The project focuses on creating an interactive user experience for donating to charitable causes.

Key Features:
  1. Donation Cards: Users can browse donation causes displayed as interactive cards.
      Each card includes:
        a. A description of the cause.
        b. An input field to specify the donation amount.
        c. A "Donate" button to submit the contribution.

  2. Real-Time Updates
       JavaScript dynamically:
        a. Adds the donated amount to the cardâ€™s "Total Donations" counter.
        b. Deducts the amount from the global "Remaining Goal" displayed at the top-right.

  3, Toggleable Pages
      Buttons that switches between:
        a. The main donation page.
        b. A transaction history page (to view past donations).

Technologies Used:
Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks/libraries).
